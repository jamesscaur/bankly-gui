# bankly-gui

Unofficial frontend for Bankly - all logos, branding etc. belongs to them.

- `yarn install`
- `yarn dev`

Note: Relies on [bankly-js](https://github.com/jesobreira/bankly-js) by [jesobreira](https://github.com/jesobreira).

However, I've checked the latest package (1.2.3) and it doesn't contain any calls to any URLs except Bankly.

Makes use of some JSON formatting code the creator of https://chainz.cryptoid.info/ shared with me.
